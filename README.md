## Benefits
* You don't have to browse through the *fantasy premier league website* to find the latest points for each manager, with just one command you will get the immediate update.
* whohas makes it easy for the user to just simply use one command `/whohas <playerName>` instead of going through on each and every manager page one by one which is very time consuming and frustrating. In a smaller league with 10 Manager that will probably take about 7 minutes but with this feature, output will be in seconds. 
* `/captains` again is an amazing feature that gives you list of all the captains with one command 


## Features to be added
* `/benchpoints` - will give a list of manager with total bench points
